#Write a function that returns the sum of the first n numbers of the
#Fibonacci sequence (Wikipedia). The first 2 numbers in the sequence
#are 1,1, â€¦

user enters Nterms

loop until Nterms == 0
    call Fibonacci(Nterms)
    sum = Fibonacci(Nterms)
    NTerms - 1
    


Examples
    sum of first 1 terms = 1
    sum of first 2 terms = 2
    sum of first 3 terms = 4
    sum of first 1 terms = 1

Fix order because order starts from 1
