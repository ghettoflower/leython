#Python is a programming language

#It is different from some other programming languages because it does
#not use semi-colons to end a line.
#There are also no curly brackets

print("Hello, world!") #This single lline can run. It does not need to be placed in a main method


#Indentation in Python is important as it defines scopes/blocks of code

if 1 > 0:
    print("1 is more than none")

#Variable types are not declared

var1 = "A random string"
var2 = "100"

print(var1)
print(var2)
